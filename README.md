I am making a Minesweper game.
If you did not install some necessary library for this file (customTkinter, tkinter, Pillow) let install it. There are a main file (game.py) , data file , 3 pictures, 1 ico file , 3 folder of libarary (it will necessary if you can not install it well) and an exe file which convert from python file.
Thank you for your attention.
